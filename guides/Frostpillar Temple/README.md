Paragraphs that start with the word “**META**” are just explaining one way to do things. You don’t have to follow it. (Sort of like dodging left during panic phase in Papulatus).

## Phases

### Floor 1~5
There will be 3 paths that lead to the Bjorn. Left, middle, and right. After defeating the adds at Floor 5, a portal will spawn and it will teleport players to the platform (marked with X in the picture below) where Bjorn is.

Kill all adds on each floor to unlock the access to the next floor.

Tip: There are more adds in the middle path, so ideally you want to have the party split up 3 left / 4 middle / 3 right.
