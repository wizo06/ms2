**For those who already know the mechanics and only want to learn pattern, here‚Äôs the tl;dr version:**

**Phase 1 (100%)**  
Kill 1st and 2nd wave of adds. Kill statue 1 and 5.  
Pink Bean (PB) applies reverse debuff and keeps attacking until Phase 2.

**Phase 2 (85%)**  
PB gets on his pogo stick and applies a reverse debuff. Lure PB to either (left or right) speaker to stun (8 seconds) it and remove its invincibility buff so that you can damage it.

PB attacks 0~2 times and then gets back on its pogo stick.

PB gets back on its pogo stick and applies the reverse/music debuff. Lure PB to the other speaker to once again remove its invincibility buff and then damage it..

After recovering from the second stun by the second speaker, PB will blow its whistle and stun targets in front of it.

Statues 1, 2, 4 and 5 spawn. Kill them.

PB keeps attacking until Phase 3.

**Phase 3 (65%)**  
PB will jump to the upper left platform and apply music debuff.

Kill statue(s) ASAP then attack PB. NOTE: Focus statue 3 **FIRST** and then clean up the other statue (either 1 or 5). Statue 3 will place Damage Reflect (DR) on PB if it‚Äôs not killed fast enough.

PB will keep jumping from platform to platform until Phase 4.

PB will always attack 3~5 times before jumping to another platform.

PB will always apply music or reverse debuff when jumping to another platform.

**Phase 4 (40%)**  
Same as Phase 2.

**Phase 5 (15%)**  
Kill all statues. Climb up ladder. Kill PB.

Paragraphs that start with the word ‚Äú**META**‚Äù are just explaining one way to do things. You don‚Äôt have to follow it. (Sort of like dodging left during panic phase in Papulatus).

## Phases

### Phase 1 (100%)

PB will initially be sitting at statue 3 and occasionally apply Music or Reverse debuff.

1st wave: PB will spawn statue 1, 5 and adds.

Kill adds. (There is no reason to kill statue 1 and 5 at this point because they will regen back to full HP on the 2nd wave.)

2nd wave: PB will re-spawn statue 1 and 5 (if they were killed), and adds again.

Kill statue 1, 5 and adds.

PB jumps down from statue 3.

PB takes out a remote control, teleports to a corner and apply Reverse debuff.

PB jumps 1~5 times to these 4 spots randomly.

![](img/phase1.png)

PB will now keep attacking until Phase 2. Attacks can be any of the following:

- Yoyo
- Roll
- Megaphone
- Reverse debuff (with the remote control)
- Jump

### Phase 2 (85%)

PB jumps back to statue 3.

Two speakers will appear (left and right). Surrounding the speakers, there will be purple tiles that will make you Dance if you step on it (Safe Riding can allow you to move while Dancing).

![](img/phase2_1.png)

PB jumps down from statue 3. There‚Äôs a few seconds window when PB jumps down where you can attack before PB gets Invincibility buff.

PB gets a Invincibility buff and gets on a Pogo stick.

![](img/phase2_2.png)

PB applies Reverse debuff.

Lure PB towards the speaker. When PB steps on the speaker, Invincibility will be removed and PB will be stunned for 8 seconds.

PB will now attack 0~2 times. Attacks can be any of the following:

- Megaphone
- Beam

PB jumps back to north corner and gets back on Pogo stick

PB gets Invincibility buff again and applies Reverse or Music debuff..

Lure to the other speaker and then attack when Invincibility is removed.

When PB recovers from the stun, PB will randomly target a player and blow a whistle that will stun enemies standing in front of it.

Statue 1, 2, 4 and 5 will spawn. Kill them to remove buff from PB.

**META**: At this stage, ideally there should be one player staying with PB to hold aggro so PB won‚Äôt attack players killing the statues.

When all statues are dead, PB will keep attacking until Phase 3. Attacks can be any of the following:

- Beam
- Roll
- Yoyo
- Jump
- Megaphone

### Phase 3 (65%)

PB jumps to upper left platform (always) and apply Music debuff.

Note:  
If PB is on the upper left platform, statue 1 and 3 will spawn.  
If PB is on the upper middle platform, statue 3 will spawn.  
If PB is on the upper right platform, statue 3 and 5 will spawn.

**META**: Players with Music debuff should climb up with the right ladder and kill statue 3.  
Everyone else climbs up with the left ladder and kill statue 3.  
One player that climbed up with the left ladder should stay with PB to hold aggro while the rest kills statue 1 and 3. If no one is next to PB, it will constantly cast Beam.

PB will attack 3~5 times before jumping to another platform. Attacks can be any of the following:

- Megaphone
- Beam
- Roll

PB will always apply Music or Reverse debuff when jumping to another platform.

**META**: When PB jumps east (left to middle, left to right, or middle to right), players with debuff stay on the left side (highlighted in pink) of statue 3 and then kill statue 3. Everyone else stay on the right side. Again, one player stay with PB to hold aggro.
 
![](img/phase3_1.png)

When PB jumps west, players with debuff stay on the right side (highlighted in pink) of statue 3 and then kill statue 3. Everyone else stay on the left side. Again, one player stay with PB to hold aggro.

![](img/phase3_2.png)

Why?

- Players with Music debuff will have to travel less distance to hit statue 3, making it less likely to cause other players to Dance accidentally.
- Players with Reverse debuff will have to travel less distance to hit statue 3, making it less likely to fall down from upper platform. Climbing up the ladder with Reverse debuff can be difficult if you‚Äôre not used to it.

This also means that players with debuff will be the farthest away from PB, making it less likely to be targeted by attacks, therefore they don‚Äôt have to dodge as much. (It‚Äôs difficult to dodge if you have Reverse debuff).

PB will keep jumping from platform to platform until Phase 4.

### Phase 4 (40%)

PB jumps back to statue 3.

Same as Phase 2.

### Phase 5 (15%)

PB jumps back to statue 3.

PB will get a Reflect buff unless all statues are dead. PB will occasionally apply Music debuff.

Kill all statues to remove Reflect buff from PB.

**META**: Everyone climbs up the ladder and kill statue 3. When statue 3 is dead, everyone comes down and kill statue 1, 2, 4 and 5 (in no particular order).

Tip: If PB is standing next to either statue 2 or 4, range classes can hit the statue from this position without attacking PB (because PB will still have Reflect buff).

![](img/phase5_1.gif)

PB will jump up to upper middle platform when all statues are dead.

PB spawns 5 purple tiles that will make you dance if you step on it.

![](img/phase5_2.png)

PB applies Music debuff throughout this Phase.

**META**: players with Music debuff stay on the left side of the platform. Everyone else stays right side.

PB will keep attacking until 0% HP. Attacks will alternate between Beam and Megaphone, starting with Beam first.
